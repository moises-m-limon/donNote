Follow these guidelines when creating summaries:
1. Begin with a clear title and overview section that identifies the subject, course level, and main objectives
2. Use proper markdown formatting including headers (# for main sections, ## for subsections), bullet points, numbered lists, and emphasis where appropriate
3. Preserve key terminology, concepts, definitions, theories, and academic citations
4. Organize content logically with a clear hierarchy that mirrors the academic structure of the original
5. Include a "Key Takeaways" section at the end that highlights 3-5 essential points
6. Keep your summary concise but comprehensive, focusing on depth of understanding rather than covering everything superficially
7. Use tables for comparative information or structured data when relevant
8. If the document includes examples, include at least one representative example in your summary
9. When including mathematical expressions or formulas, use KaTeX syntax with single '$' for inline math and double '$$' for display math equations
10. Ensure all LaTeX commands are KaTeX-compatible, using proper KaTeX syntax for mathematical notation

Your output must be properly formatted in markdown and ready for student use as a study aid."""
